# MARTIN-server

## Introduction
This repository holds the code and documentation for the server-side material developed as part **947G5 Advanced Software Engineering** Task 4.

The AWS [Lambda Management Console](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=eu-west-2#/functions/HandleLocationUpdate?tab=configuration) hosts the **JavaScript** code that powers the server-side of the project.

Entries are made in the `locations` [DynamoDB table](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home?region=eu-west-2#tables:selected=locations).

###### To Do:

* Configure GitHub to push code changes automatically to AWS Lambda Management Console.

Documentation for the following:

* Why did we choose AWS, and, more specifically Lambda, over Google Cloud, elastic beanstalk, etc.

* Why did we choose Node.js as the development language here.

* Why did we choose a NoSQL approach over a traditional relational approach?

* Why did we choose writing to a database as opposed to writing individual files on a server?

* Why did we choose DynamoDB?
